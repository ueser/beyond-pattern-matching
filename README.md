# Beyond Pattern Matching: Hierarchical Motif Discovery

This repository implements a hierarchical motif discovery system for evolving Brainfuck programs on sequence generation tasks. The system discovers multi-level motifs (L1, L2, L3, ...) and uses them to evolve increasingly sophisticated programs.

## Overview

The project demonstrates how evolutionary algorithms can discover hierarchical patterns in code, moving beyond simple pattern matching to build compositional program structures. Programs evolve to solve sequence generation tasks (arithmetic progressions, oscillators, etc.) while the system automatically discovers reusable motifs at multiple abstraction levels.

### Analogy: Learning to Cook

To understand how the system works, imagine a chef who only knows basic actions: `chop`, `stir`, `heat`, `add_salt`.

1.  **Evolve (Practice)**: They try random combinations to make "scrambled eggs." After many attempts, they succeed with a sequence like `crack_egg`, `whisk`, `heat_pan`, `add_to_pan`, `stir`.

2.  **Mine (Find Patterns)**: They notice they frequently perform `crack_egg` -> `whisk`. They decide to call this new skill **"prepare_eggs"**. This is a Level 1 (L1) motif.

3.  **Enrich Grammar (Learn)**: Their internal cookbook now has a new, high-level recipe: "prepare_eggs".

4.  **Evolve (Practice Again)**: Now, when trying to make an omelette, they don't have to think about the individual steps. They can just use their **"prepare_eggs"** skill. This makes it much faster to discover the full omelette recipe.

5.  **Mine (Find Higher-Level Patterns)**: After making many dishes, they realize that the sequence **"prepare_eggs"** -> `add_cheese` -> `fold` is a very common and useful pattern. They name this even higher-level skill **"make_cheese_omelette"**. This is a Level 2 (L2) motif, built upon an L1 motif.

This application does exactly that, but for programming. It discovers fundamental building blocks and then composes them into increasingly powerful and abstract skills, demonstrating a scalable approach to automated learning and problem-solving.

## Key Features

- **Multi-level Hierarchical Motif Discovery**: Automatically discovers motifs at L1 (primitive combinations), L2 (L1 motif combinations), L3 (L1+L2 combinations), etc.
- **Grammar-based Evolution**: Uses Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFGs) for program generation and evolution
- **Behavioral Validation**: Ensures discovered motifs are behaviorally meaningful, not just syntactic patterns
- **MDL-based Quality Control**: Uses Minimum Description Length to filter high-quality, compressive motifs
- **Iterative Evolution**: Evolves programs, discovers motifs, updates grammar, and repeats for continuous improvement

## Quick Start

### 1. Run Hierarchical Evolution Pipeline

The main experiment that demonstrates the full hierarchical motif discovery system:

```bash
cd primitive-evolution/blog_demos
python experiments/evolve_with_hierarchical_motifs.py experiments/config.yaml
```

This will:
1. Start with a minimal grammar
2. Evolve programs on sequence tasks
3. Mine hierarchical motifs from successful programs
4. Update the grammar with discovered motifs
5. Repeat for multiple iterations

### 2. Run Individual Components

**Grammar-based Evolution Only:**
```bash
python experiments/evolve_with_cfg.py --grammar motifs/minimal_cfg.json --pop 1000 --gens 100
```

**Baseline Evolution (no grammar):**
```bash
python experiments/evolve_baseline.py --pop 1000 --gens 100
```

### 3. Configuration

Edit `experiments/config.yaml` to customize:

```yaml
task_suite: sequences              # Task suite to use
max_iterations: 10                 # Number of evolution-mining cycles
evo:
  population_size: 10000          # Evolution population size
  generations: 500                # Generations per evolution round
  step_limit: 1000               # Max steps for program execution
mine:
  enabled: true                   # Enable motif mining
  min_support: 4                  # Minimum motif frequency
  min_len: 3                     # Minimum motif length
```

## System Architecture

### Hierarchical Motif Discovery

The system implements a multi-level motif discovery algorithm:

1. **L1 Motifs**: Combinations of primitives (`++`, `--`, `><`, etc.)
   - Discovered through behavioral validation and MDL scoring
   - Must be behaviorally meaningful (not just syntactic patterns)

2. **L2 Motifs**: Combinations of L1 motifs (`[L1M1, L1M3]`, etc.)
   - Discovered from symbolized programs using L1 motifs
   - Must be acyclic (no self-references)

3. **L3+ Motifs**: Combinations of lower-level motifs
   - Recursive application of the same algorithm
   - Maintains strict level hierarchy

### Key Algorithms

**Iterative L1 Mining**: Ensures complete primitive coverage by mining L1 motifs in multiple rounds until no new patterns emerge.

**Primitive Rejection**: L2+ mining rejects primitive-only patterns that should have been discovered at L1.

**MDL-based Filtering**: Uses Minimum Description Length to ensure motifs provide compression benefit.

**Acyclicity Enforcement**: Prevents grammar cycles by ensuring level-K motifs only reference motifs with level < K.

## Example Output

The system discovers motifs like:

```
L1 Motifs (primitives → tokens):
  L1M1: "++"     (increment twice)
  L1M2: "--"     (decrement twice)
  L1M3: "><"     (move right then left)

L2 Motifs (L1 motifs → symbols):
  L2M1: [L1M1, L1M2]  (increment twice, then decrement twice)
  L2M2: [L1M3, L1M1]  (move right-left, then increment twice)

L3 Motifs (L1+L2 motifs → higher-order symbols):
  L3M1: [L2M1, L1M3]  (complex behavioral pattern)
```

## Tasks

The system evolves programs to solve sequence generation tasks:

- **Arithmetic**: `1,2,3,4,5...` (increment)
- **Geometric**: `1,2,4,8,16...` (doubling)
- **Oscillators**: `1,3,1,3,1,3...` (alternating)
- **Modular**: `1,2,3,1,2,3...` (cyclic patterns)
- **Complex**: Multi-step transformations

## Research Applications

This system demonstrates:

- **Automatic Program Synthesis**: Discovering reusable code patterns
- **Hierarchical Abstraction**: Building compositional program structures
- **Evolutionary Computation**: Grammar-guided program evolution
- **Motif Discovery**: Finding meaningful patterns in code
- **Compression-based Learning**: Using MDL for pattern quality assessment
